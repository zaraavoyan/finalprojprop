#### Zara's Final Project Proposal

## Summary (artistic/design vision):
- I would like to ideally train a GAN based style transfer trained on my own painting - or series of paintings, to be applied as a filter on top of photographs.

## Physical Parts/ Components:
- None

## Deconstruction / System Diagram:

* Example with other paintings

## What is going to be hard/ uncertain?
-At this current moment, pretty much everything. Since I'm learning ML and Python from scratch, a bunch of the details including the working timeline aren't very tangible for me - I will, at least, try to get as far as I can as fast as I can.

## Timeline:
* Now - Week 7: Learn
* Week 7 - Final Presentation: Code
